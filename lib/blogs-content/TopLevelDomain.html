        <h2 style="text-align:center; color:#2563EB;">Ever wondered why most websites end with ".com"?</h2>
        <img class="blog-img" src="/images/TLD.svg">
        <p><span style="font-size:xx-large;color:#2563EB;"><strong>.com</strong></span> is a Top Level Domain Name. Let's first
            understand what a domain name is.<br><br>
            <span style="text-decoration: underline; color:#2563EB;"><strong><em>Domain Name:</em></strong></span><br><br>It is an identification string that defines the control &
            authority of the website in & across the internet.
            Domain names are used for identifying a network but it can also be used to represent an Internet Protocol
            resource, such as a personal computer used to access the
            Internet, a server computer hosting a website, or the web site itself or any other service communicated via
            the Internet.</p>

        <p>What is a <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;color:#2563EB;">Top Level Domain Name?</span></em></strong><br><br>
            Just like your name is followed by your second name/middle name & then surname to identify your lineage,
            domain names too have a hierarchy followed in them.
            The topmost ancestral name (mostly the surname) can be thought of as the Top Level Name in your family.
            Similarly, we have the Top Level Domain Name underwhich the different domain names are associated with each
            other forming a hierarchy. </p>

        <p>Responsibility for management of most top-level domains is
            delegated to specific organizations by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN),
            which operates the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), and is in charge of maintaining the DNS root
            zone. </p>

        <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;color:#2563EB;"><strong><em>How are domain names formed?</em></strong></span><br><br>Domain names are formed by the
            rules and procedures of the Domain Name System (DNS). Any name registered in
            the DNS is a domain name. Domain names are organized in subordinate levels (subdomains) of the DNS root
            domain, which is nameless. The first-level set of domain names are the top-level domains (TLDs), including
            the generic top-level domains (gTLDs), such as the prominent domains <strong>com, info, net, edu, and org,
                and the country code top-level domains (ccTLDs)</strong>. <br><br>Below these top-level domains in the
            DNS
            hierarchy are the second-level and third-level domain names that are typically open for reservation by
            end-users who wish to connect local area networks to the Internet, create other publicly accessible Internet
            resources or run web sites.</p>

        <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;color:#2563EB;"><strong><em>How can one register a domain name?</em></strong></span><br><br>
            The registration of these domain names is usually administered by domain name registrars who sell their
            services to the public.</p>
