        <p> A <strong>top-level domain (TLD)</strong> is one of the domains at the highest level in the hierarchical
            <strong>Domain Name System</strong> of the Internet. The top-level domain names are installed in the root
            zone of the name space. For all domains in lower levels, it is the last part of the domain name, that is,
            the last label of a fully qualified domain name. For example, in the domain name www.example.com, the
            top-level domain is <strong>com</strong>. Responsibility for management of most top-level domains is
            delegated to specific organizations by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN),
            which operates the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), and is in charge of maintaining the DNS root
            zone.
        </p>
        <p>
            A <strong>domain name</strong> is an identification string that defines a realm of administrative autonomy,
            authority or control within the Internet. Domain names are used in various networking contexts and for
            application-specific naming and addressing purposes. In general, a domain name identifies a network domain,
            or it represents an Internet Protocol (IP) resource, such as a personal computer used to access the
            Internet, a server computer hosting a website, or the web site itself or any other service communicated via
            the Internet.
        </p>
        <p>Domain names are formed by the rules and procedures of the Domain Name System (DNS). Any name registered in
            the DNS is a domain name. Domain names are organized in subordinate levels (subdomains) of the DNS root
            domain, which is nameless. The first-level set of domain names are the top-level domains (TLDs), including
            the generic top-level domains (gTLDs), such as the prominent domains <strong>com, info, net, edu, and org,
                and the country code top-level domains (ccTLDs)</strong>. Below these top-level domains in the DNS
            hierarchy are the second-level and third-level domain names that are typically open for reservation by
            end-users who wish to connect local area networks to the Internet, create other publicly accessible Internet
            resources or run web sites.

            The registration of these domain names is usually administered by domain name registrars who sell their
            services to the public.</p>
